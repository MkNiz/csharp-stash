# Structure

Demonstrates a structure (struct) in C#. This behaves similarly to a class in some
ways as it has instance variables and methods, but has significant differences.

A struct cannot have a parameterless constructor, and it resides on the stack instead of the heap.

They are also value types, meaning a full object gets passed around instead of a reference.
